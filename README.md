# Music Organizer Assignment

This repository contains my implementation of the Music Organizer assignment from the INDA course at KTH, DD1337, in 2021 August. The project focuses on mastering Java programming concepts, including object-oriented design, data structures, and control flows, while enhancing functionality in a music organizer application.

## Assignment Overview

### Objectives:
1. **Enhance Existing Code:** Modify the `MusicOrganizer` project to add robust features, including index validation, file listing, and shuffle play.
2. **Develop New Features:** Implement additional methods for file management and advanced playlist functionalities.
3. **Practice Java Basics:** Write standalone methods in a new class (`Loops.java`) to reinforce control flow, loops, and prime number detection.

### Deliverables:
- Updated `MusicOrganizer` projects across multiple versions.
- Written Java solutions to exercises in the `Loops.java` class.

## Repository Contents

- `music-organizer-v1/`: Contains the initial version of the Music Organizer project with foundational improvements.
- `music-organizer-v3/`: Introduces advanced file management features like matching, indexing, and playing tracks by artist.
- `music-organizer-v5/`: Implements shuffle and random-play functionalities.
- `Loops.java`: Solutions for control flow exercises, including loops, summation, and prime number detection.
- `docs/`: Contains written explanations and answers to theoretical questions.
- `src/`: Java source files with the implemented functionality.

## Key Highlights

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Extended functionality of the `MusicOrganizer` class while maintaining modular code.
- **Problem-Solving:** Designed algorithms for random track selection and prime number detection.
- **Attention to Detail:** Ensured robustness with index validation and automated repetitive tasks using Java methods.
- **Cross-Tool Adaptability:** Adapted external libraries (javazoom) for enhanced music playback, handling cross-platform compatibility.
